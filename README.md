# Drowsiness Detection System

The Drowsiness Detection System is a project designed to monitor and detect drowsiness in individuals using a webcam feed in real-time. It leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze facial landmarks, particularly focusing on the movements of the eyes.

The system works by first detecting faces in the webcam feed using the Dlib library. Once a face is detected, the system identifies the landmarks of the face, particularly the landmarks around the eyes. By tracking the positions of these landmarks over time, the system can analyze blinking patterns.

The project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for monitoring drowsiness, particularly in contexts where individuals need to stay alert, such as while driving or operating heavy machinery. It serves as a proactive tool to help prevent accidents and promote safety.
